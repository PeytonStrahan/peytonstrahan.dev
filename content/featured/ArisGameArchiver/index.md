This product will keep track of a list of games for you. While the main purpose of this product is to keep a list of the games you have played (with favorite games being the games they enjoyed playing the most), This product could also technically be used to allow gamers to keep a list of the games that they want (with favorite games being the games they want the most), whatever floats your boat. Each game will have a link to the RAWG website, which can tell you more about each game. You can add more games to your lists, remove games from the list, and favorite/unfavorite games in the list. You can also sort your list by name, release year, or rating.
